Please ignore this repo, it was for a cyber competition and I didn't want my opponents to figure it out.
This repo sets up cowrie, a honeypot.

If you still want to look at this repo, cs.sh downloads the files necessary for Cowrie (twistd needs to be downloaded still).
Cowriestart.sh starts Cowrie up.
